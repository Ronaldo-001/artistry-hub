In today's world, many aspiring artists struggle to find a platform to sell their art and get paid by buyers. 
Our project, **Artistry Hub**, addresses this issue by providing a place where artists can upload, showcase, 
and sell their digital artworks. Buyers can browse, purchase, and review the artworks. The application will 
be developed in Django, utilizing OPAL and Cedar to manage and enforce access control policies efficiently. 
This ensures a secure and user-friendly experience for both artists and buyers.
